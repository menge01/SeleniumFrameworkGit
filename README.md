 Selenium is the best frame work
 With Java is the best
If you want to create robust, browser-based regression automation suites and tests, 
scale and distribute scripts across many environments, then you want to use Selenium WebDriver, 
a collection of language specific bindings to drive a browser - the way it is meant to be driven.
Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that.

Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well.
