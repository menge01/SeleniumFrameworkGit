If you want to create quick bug reproduction scripts, create scripts to aid in automation-aided exploratory testing, 
then you want to use Selenium IDE; a Chrome, Firefox and Edge add-on that will do simple record-and-playback of interactions with the browser. Selenium is the best frame work With Java is the best
If you want to create robust, browser-based regression automation suites and tests, 
scale and distribute scripts across many environments, then you want to use Selenium WebDriver, 
a collection of language specific bindings to drive a browser - the way it is meant to be driven.

Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that.

Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well.

If you want to scale by distributing and running tests on several machines and manage multiple environments from a central point,
 making it easy to run the tests against a vast combination of browsers/OS, then you want to use Selenium Grid.
